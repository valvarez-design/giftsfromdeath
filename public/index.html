                <p>"The word 'death' is not pronounced in New York, in Paris, in London, because it burns the lips. The Mexican, in contrast, is familiar with death, jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it; it is one of his favorite toys and his most steadfast love."</p>

                <p class="section">Growing up, I believed the dead followed me. Not as ghosts that evoked fear, but as companions - invisible guardians walking beside me through life. This wasn't superstition, it was culture.</p>
                
                <p class="section">In Mexican tradition, death is not an ending. The dead don't leave us. They linger in the smell of marigolds, in dreams, in moments when grief softens into something that feels like presence.</p>
                
                <p class="section">Western grief culture tells us to "move on," to "let go," to complete our "stages" and arrive at "closure." It pathologizes ongoing bonds with the dead as unhealthy attachment. It medicalizes what other cultures know as sacred.</p>
                
                <p class="section2">But what if grief doesn't end because love doesn't end?</p>
                
                <p class="section2">What if the dead walk beside us, what if their energy lingers and we're not crazy for still feeling them?</p>
                
                <p class="section">This project is a space for those moments, the ones we're told don't exist. The dream where they spoke. The song that came on at the exact right time. The feeling of a hand on your shoulder when the room was empty. The unexplainable luck that leaves you in disbelief. </p>
